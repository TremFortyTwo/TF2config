TF2config
=========

HUD, hitsound and blah for TF2

If you want to use my class configs and fps config (chris' maxframes, uses dxlevel8), put 'cfg' in the 'tf' directory

For the HUD/hitsound/skins, put the vpk files and/or the directories of the custom stuff you want to use (hud, for example) in tf/custom
